# Serialization

Create each of your classes as new `.java` files in `src/main/java`.  Then update `Main.java` according to the TODO comments.
This is a Maven project so to run it, use this command:
```
mvn compile exec:java
```

In class, I showed how to use Jackson for serialization to / from JSON.  For this assignment, you should practice with another popular library [gson](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md)
